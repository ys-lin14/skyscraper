# SkyScraper
An ETL pipeline for scraping Google Play reviews for [Sky: Children of the Light](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.sky.android&hl=en_CA&gl=US). I used Airflow for task scheduling, extracted the data using the [google-play-scraper](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/) library, transformed it with pandas and loaded it into a local MySQL database.
